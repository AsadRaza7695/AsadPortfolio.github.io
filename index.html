          <h3>Neural Network from Scratch (Stochastic Gradient Descent & Full Batch Gradient Descent)</h3>
          <p>Used Stochastic Gradient Descent to predict house prices. Code was done in python and whole neural network was made from scratch without using 
            major in built libraries like keras.

          <h3>Automatic Drip Irrigation System</h3>
          <p>In this system, soil moisture sensor senses the moisture level of the soil.
             If soil will get dry then sensor senses low moisture level and automatically
              switches on the water pump to supply water to the plant. As plant get sufficient
               water and soil get wet then sensor senses enough moisture in soil and water pump 
               will stop. System will also display Temperature, humidity along with Moisture level of each plant in Percentage.</p>

            <h3>Database with Desktop Application</h3>
            <p>A real-time project for a client who has a retail business of electric devices.
              A desktop application was made along with a relational database.
              Clients can keep records of customers, employees, stock, and other useful information.
              Login authentication was provided to users. Statistical data can also be retrieved from this application.
              PDF billing option was also available. Rights of different users were managed in the backend of the database.</p>

        <h3>Face Recognition Attendance System</h3>
        <p>Our project is a real-time face recognition system using the "face_recognition" library and OpenCV. It starts by loading a set of known face images from a specified directory and storing them along with their corresponding class names. The code then captures video frames from a webcam, detects faces in the frames, and compares them with the known faces using face encodings. When a match is found, it marks the attendance of the recognized individual by appending their name and timestamp to a CSV file.

          To accomplish this, the project utilizes the "face_recognition" library, which simplifies face detection, facial feature extraction, and face recognition tasks. The library employs a pre-trained deep learning model to detect faces, identify facial landmarks, and extract face encodings. It then compares the computed face encodings with the known encodings to determine if there is a match. 
          
          Project provides a convenient way to perform real-time face recognition by leveraging the "face_recognition" library.

        <h3>Potholes and Cracks Segmentation</h3>
        <p>My Final year project was to segment defects on roads i.e Potholes and Cracks. I created my own dataset of Pakistani roads. Annotated it on Roboflow and useit to train 
          my own model. UNET and Detectron2 model were used for segmentation
